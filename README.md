# UD Latin PROIEL

The Latin PROIEL treebank is based on the Latin data from the PROIEL treebank, which is maintained at the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Arts and Ideas at the University of Oslo. The data have been automatically converted to the UD scheme by Dag Haug. The conversion is based on the 20151028 release of the PROIEL treebank available from https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/releases. The original annotators are acknowledged in the files available there. The conversion code is available in the Rubygem proiel-cli, https://github.com/proiel/proiel-cli.

The treebank contains most of the Vulgate New Testament translation plus selections from Caesar's Gallic War and Cicero's Letters to Atticus. The original annotation guidelines are available at http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf.

## Data splits
The development data consists of the 9th, 19th, 29th etc. sentences of the converted treebank and the test set of the 10th, 20th, 30th etc.  sentences.
